Data Fetching:

We use the fetch() function to get the data from the API.
If the fetch fails, we show an error message using alert().
Search:

The search functionality filters products based on the title entered in the search bar.
Filters:

We provide dropdown filters for price and popularity ranges. When a filter is applied, the products are re-filtered and rendered.
Sorting:

Sorting is applied based on the selected field (price or popularity) and order (ascending or descending).
Pagination:

Products are displayed in pages of 20 items each, with controls for navigating between pages.
Product Details Modal:

When a product row is clicked, a modal opens with the detailed information for that product.
